 * NAME
 *   device_info -- Get information about a mounted DOS device.
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   This is a simple set of functions to obtain information about a
 *   mounted DOS device *by drive name*, not by device name and unit number.
 *
 *   The main motivation has been that many programs expect the user to
 *   specify device and unit instead of simply the drive name. For example,
 *   instead of "cd0:" it has to be "scsi.device", unit 6.
 *
 *   This is extremely tedious in most cases because nobody wants to keep
 *   SCSI-ID's in mind - not to mention that they might change.
 *
 *   And why should one have to fiddle with several setups once a new serial
 *   card is installed and replace the string "serial.device" by
 *   "new-serial.device" in loads of settings windows? Let the user specify
 *   "SER:" and as time comes map "SER:" to a better device without the need
 *   to tell this every program.
 *
 *   The only problem about that is that it is a bit annoying for
 *   programmers to collect this information together "manually". You have
 *   to lock the DosList, dig around in obscure data structures and fiddle
 *   with BCPL strings.
 *
 *   These functions free you from this work. The device_info_t structure
 *   uses C strings and does not require any locking as everything is
 *   copied "by value" into the structure. No pointer references are used,
 *   so you can access the data even if the drive was ejected, unmounted
 *   or replaced. Of course this does not spare you a decent error handling,
 *   but you can be sure not to access any already released memory.
 *
 *   For compiling this material, use the included makefile and possible
 *   additional files:
 *
 *   smakefile, SCOPTIONS  - For SAS/c 6.57
 *   Makefile              - For gcc 2.7.2
 *
 *   The code should also work with Dice C.

 *   result = dupBSTR( c_target, bcpl_source )

 *   static BOOL dupBSTR( STRPTR *, BSTR );
 * FUNCTION
 *   Convert a BCPL string to a C string and allocate an own memory area for

 * INPUTS
 *   c_target    - Variable to hold the converted string
 *   bcpl_source - BCPL string to duplicate.
 * RESULT
 *   TRUE if the memory could be allocated.
 *
 *   In case of error, FALSE is returned and IoErr() is set to
 *   ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE.
 *
 *   If source is NULL, c_target also is set to NULL, but still success
 *   is TRUE.

/****** get_device_info ****************************************************
 * NAME
 *   get_device_info -- Get information about the given device..
 * SYNOPSIS
 *   device_info = get_device_info( name )
 *
 *   device_info_t *get_device_info( STRPTR );
 * FUNCTION
 *   Get information about the given device.
 *
 *   This is achieved by scanning the locking the DosList using
 *   LockDosList() and search for the device using FindDosEntry(). The
 *   resulting data are copied into own memory areas (by value) and no
 *   references to the original are kept. The DosList is then unlocked
 *   again.
 *
 *   Some convenient translations are performed, e.g. BCPL strings are
 *   converted to zero terminated C strings and the block size is stored
 *   in bytes instead of longs.
 *
 *   To give back these resources once they are not needed any more, you
 *   have to call free_device_info().
 * INPUTS
 *   name - Zero terminated device name, including trailing colon (:), for
 *          example "df0:".
 * RESULT
 *   If the information could be obtained, the full a full device_info_t
 *   is returned.
 *
 *   In case of error, NULL is returned and IoErr() contains more
 *   information. Possible values are:
 *
 *   ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE          - Not enough memory
 *   ERROR_INVALID_COMPONENT_NAME - 'name' did not end in ":"
 *   ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_MOUNTED     - Could not find any information about
 *                                  the requested device
 * NOTES
 *   Not all string fields of device_info-T have to contain values. For
 *   example, "df0:" does not have a handler but only a device, so
 *   device_info->handler is NULL.
 *
 *   If device_info->device is NULL, most numeric fields are so. In such
 *   a case, device_info->unit is -1. This can happen for example with
 *   "Ram:".
